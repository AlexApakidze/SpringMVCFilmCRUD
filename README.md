# SpringMVCFilmCRUD

## Description

In this project, pair programming was front and center. Using GitHub and a shared repository, we created a website that accesses a database through SQL. The user can then view a list of films and parameters by looking up by film ID number or keyword to find films. The user can also add films to the database, edit the films already present, and delete any film.

## Lessons Learned

The SPringMVCFilmCRUD project taught us how to navigate different classes and files to pass information between them. We used Java to communicate with a database to add/update/delete database entries. We used HTML to take inputs from a user, instantiate new classes with the user inputs, and permanently alter the database. We created controller methods to perform the tasks needed based on user choice. Each controller method was the link between the user request and HTML response.
